### Network Traffic Simulation and Security Analysis

Designed and implemented a network simulation using simpy to model traffic flow, packet transmission, and queuing behavior across a multi-router network.
Developed routing algorithms and simulated network latency, queue lengths, and packet drop rates to analyze network efficiency and security vulnerabilities.
Used networkx to visualize network topology, assess potential attack vectors, and analyze network resilience against congestion-based attacks.
Implemented packet loss monitoring and traffic analysis, which are critical for detecting anomalies and potential Denial-of-Service (DoS) attacks.
Applied probabilistic modeling to simulate real-world network behaviors, helping in intrusion detection and network forensics.
